Install NVIDIA Driver
Make sure your GPU driver is up to date (check using nvidia-smi). It should support CUDA 11.8.

2. Install CUDA Toolkit 11.8
Download from NVIDIA official site:
ðŸ”— https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive

Install it and ensure the installer adds the CUDA bin and libnvvp directories to your system's PATH.

3. Install cuDNN 8.6 for CUDA 11.x
Download from NVIDIA:
ðŸ”— https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive

Youâ€™ll need an NVIDIA Developer account (free). Download the cuDNN 8.6 version for CUDA 11.x and copy the contents (bin, include, lib) into your CUDA installation directory, e.g., C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\.
